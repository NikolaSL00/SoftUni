# There is a party at SoftUni. Many guests are invited, and there are two types of them:
# Regular and VIP. When a guest comes, check if they exist in any of the two reservation lists.
# On the first line, you will receive the number of guests â€“ N. On the following N lines,
# you will be receiving their reservation codes. All reservation codes are 8 characters long,
# and all VIP numbers will start with a digit. Keep in mind that all reservation numbers must be unique.
# After that, you will be receiving guests who came to the party until you read the "END" command.
# In the end, print the number of the guests who did not come to the party and their reservation numbers.
# The VIP guests must be first. Both the VIP and the Regular guests must be sorted in ascending order.
