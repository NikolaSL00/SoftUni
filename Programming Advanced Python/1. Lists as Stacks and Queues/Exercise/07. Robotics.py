# Somewhere in the future, there is a robotics factory. The current project is assembly line robots.
# Each robot has a processing time â€“ it is the time in seconds the robot needs to process a product.
# When a robot is free it should take a product for processing and log his name, product and processing start time.
# Each robot processes a product coming from the assembly line.
# A product is coming from the line each second (so the first product should appear at [start time + 1 second]).
# If a product passes the line and there is not a free robot to take it,
# it should be queued at the end of the line again.
# The robots are standing on the line in the order of their appearance.

# Input
# On the first line, you will receive the names of the robots and their processing times in the format
# "robotName-processTime;robotName-processTime;robotName-processTime..."
# On the second line, you will get the starting time in format "hh:mm:ss"
# Next, until the "End" command, you will get a product on each line.

# Output
# Every time a robot takes a product, you should print: "{robotName} - {product} [hh:mm:ss]"


# INPUT:
# ROB-15;SS2-10;NX8000-3
# 8:00:00
# detail
# glass
# wood
# apple
# End

# OUTPUT:
# ROB - detail [08:00:01]
# SS2 - glass [08:00:02]
# NX8000 - wood [08:00:03]
# NX8000 - apple [08:00:06]

# INPUT:
# ROB-8
# 7:59:59
# detail
# glass
# wood
# sock
# End

# OUTPUT:
# ROB - detail [08:00:00]
# ROB - wood [08:00:08]
# ROB - glass [08:00:16]
# ROB - sock [08:00:24]
