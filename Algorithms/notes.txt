1. Algorithm complexity
	-> Big(O) notation - operations depending of input

2. Brute force algorithms
	-> all possible variants
	
3. Recursion
	-> when my big problem can be separated into smaller simmilar problems
	-> when combining the solutions of the small problems we find the solution of the big problem

4. Backtracking
