# Create a class called Shop. Upon initialization, it should receive a name (str), type (str), capacity (int). The store should also have an attribute called items (dictionary that stores the name of an item and its quantity). The class should have 4 methods:
# small_shop(name: str, type: str) â€“ a new shop with a capacity of 10 should be created
# add_item(item_name:str) - adds 1 to the quantity of the given item. On success, the method should return "{item_name} added to the shop". If the addition is not possible, the following message should be returned "Not enough capacity in the shop"
# remove_item(item_name:str, amount:int) - removes the given amount from the item. On success, it should return "{amount} {item_name} removed from the shop". Otherwise, the method should return "Cannot remove {amount} {item_name}"
# __repr__() - returns a string representation in the format "{shop_name} of type {shop_type} with capacity {shop_capacity}"


# Test Code:
# fresh_shop = Shop("Fresh Shop", "Fruit and Veg", 50)
# small_shop = Shop.small_shop("Fashion Boutique", "Clothes")
# print(fresh_shop)
# print(small_shop)
#
# print(fresh_shop.add_item("Bananas"))
# print(fresh_shop.remove_item("Tomatoes", 2))
#
# print(small_shop.add_item("Jeans"))
# print(small_shop.add_item("Jeans"))
# print(small_shop.remove_item("Jeans", 2))

# Desired Output:
# Fresh Shop of type Fruit and Veg with capacity 50
# Fashion Boutique of type Clothes with capacity 10
# Bananas added to the shop
# Cannot remove 2 Tomatoes
# Jeans added to the shop
# Jeans added to the shop
# 2 Jeans removed from the shop
