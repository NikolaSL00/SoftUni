# Create a class called Shop. Upon initialization, it should receive a name (string) and items (list).
# Create a method called get_items_count() which should return the number of items in the store.

# Test Code
# shop = Shop("My Shop", ["Apples", "Bananas", "Cucumbers"])
# print(shop.get_items_count())

# Desired Output
# 3
